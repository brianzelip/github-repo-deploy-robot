# GitHub Repo Deploy Robot (GRDR)

A small web app form that speeds up the time it takes to create repositories on GitHub. Made for NCBI-Hackathons organizers to streamline the tedious and time consuming process of preparing pre-determined repositories before the event. The particular speed benefit here relates to adding members to the repo.
